									<h2>About me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Hi, I'm Mar! I'm a 26 year old living in Breda and 3rd year game development student at GLU.
									During this time i've developed skills in Unity, C#, scrum, and to a lesser degree PHP, MySQL and HLSL.
									During school projects I've mostly been focused on gameplay and system programming, but I'm lucky to have built a solid base for most aspects of development.

										<h3>Personal</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Ever since I was little, I've been hyperfixated with games. As someone with Autism, I would definitely call it my special interest.
										I used to play games for hours on end, trying to understand why they made me feel the ways I did.
										When I wasn't playing games, I was creating boardgames and cardgames using cardstock and coloring pencils.
										They were awful games! But the joy I feel making games now is the same joy I felt back then.
									</p>
									<p>
										Over the years I played more games, started messing around in Game Maker, and watched hundreds of videos on game design and development.
										Eventually I knew, this has to be my career. I want to craft experiences for people that move them, that stick with them for years. I want to create smiles, tears, memories both fond and frustrated. I want to make games.
